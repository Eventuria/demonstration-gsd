## 1. Definitions

GSD is distributed application based on the following concepts :
- [Domain Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) (DDD)
    - Place the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic
    - Base complex designs on a model of the domain
- [CQRS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/cqrs)
    - It stands for Command Query Responsibility Segregation.
    - It also known as the distributed version of DDD (and then DDDD as Distributed Domain Driven Design)
- Command Sourcing ( [Event Sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) ++)
    - It's Event Sourcing where commands are also persisted
        - Capture all changes to an application state as a sequence of events
        - Capture all the commands sent to the system
    - Commands sent to the system are stored and consumed asynchronously as opposed to Event Sourcing
        - The command loss when the service is down is reduced.
        - The data flow is pulled as opposed to pushed in Event Sourcing
        - you work in a stream from A-Z
    - This command consumption produces and stores in a single transaction containing
        - The Events
        - The Command Response
- [Functional Reactive Programing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming)
    - it's a programming paradigm for reactive programming (asynchronous dataflow programming) using the building blocks of functional programming (e.g. map, reduce, filter).
    - Streams (dataflow) are ubiquitous in GSD and Logs (FIFO) are the persisted version of them.
- [Micro-service Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices)
    - Services are small in size
    - Messaging (Commands) enabled
    - Bounded by contexts
    - Autonomously developed
    - Independently deployable
    - Decentralized
    - Built and released with automated processes.

All these concepts are building blocks for implementing [Kahn process networks (KPNs, or process networks)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahn_process_networks)

it's a concurrent [model of computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computation) which can be also considered as a Pattern / Architecture for distributed systems

## 2. Microservices

### 2.1 Overview

GSD is made of 6 distributed services :

- `cli` : it's a command line interface to pilot the system.
    - Sent commands to the system
    - Move to the next interface when the command is processed
    - Read eventually updated projections from its read service (hosting the gsd read model)
    - Read eventually updated projections from a monitoring service

- `command-sourcer`
    - Receives commands
    - Dispatch and Persist these commands in an aggregate command stream

- `command-consumer` : It is an orchestration from the CQRS Sagas Terminology, this service orchestrates the consumption of commands on a specific aggregate.
    - Listen on commands arriving on the command stream for each aggregates
    - Re-build the write model from the previous command transactions
    - perform the transactions on each command persisted (`handleCommand`), a command can be :
        - Accepted (contains events)
        - Rejected (contains the reason of rejection)
    - persists these command transactions

- `gsd-read`
    - reads events from the command transaction streams
    - projects a model from these events optimised for the read
    - serves that read model to the cli service

- `gsd-monitoring`
    - reads the command transaction and the command streams
    - projects a model from these events optimised for the monitoring the system
    - serves that monitoring model to the cli service

- `eventstore-service`
    - persist and give access to streams for the system
    - it's embedded into a docker container
    - it could be replaced by any other engine that implement the interfaces provided in the project.

### 2.2 Resiliency and high availability

Each service are safe (streams and bootstrap) and can only terminate by
- a SIG-INT (releasing resources properly)
- a SIG-KILL

Each service has a built-in bootstrap health-check mechanism.
The services can run till they call an unhealthy dependency, at this moment they come back in that health-check mechanism.

- `cli` is healthy, when the following dependencies are healthy :
    - `command-sourcer`
    - `command-consumer`
    - `gsd-read`
    - `gsd-monitoring`

- `command-sourcer` is healthy, when `eventstore-service` is healthy
- `command-consumer` is healthy, when `eventstore-service` is healthy
- `gsd-read` is healthy, when `eventstore-service` is healthy
- `gsd-monitoring` is healthy, when `eventstore-service` is healthy

##  3. Bounded Contexts

`Eventuria` is the name of the company hosting te codebase and it's the root package of the codebase.
By flicking through the codebase under `Eventuria`, you'll see the following packages :

<img align="right" src="packages.png"> <div><br>
- `Adapters` : it contains wrappers, tweaks on external libraries
    - `Byline` : a command line interface [library](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/byline) used for the `cli` service
    - `Servant` : HTTP Client and Server [library](https://github.com/haskell-servant) used for micro-services communication
    - `Streamly` : a Streaming [library](https://github.com/composewell/streamly)

- `Commons` : are tiny bounded contexts used within the company.

- `GSD` : Bounded Context specific to the gsd application, you'll find the 4 services explained previously in that doc
    - `CLI` : the `gsd-cli` implementation
    - `Write` :
        - `gsd-command-consumer`
        - `gsd-command-sourcer`
    - `Read` : the `gsd-read` implementation
    - `Monitoring` : the `gsd-monitoring` implementation

- `Libraries`
    - `CQRS` : Bounded Context Specific to the pattern, it could be eventually reused by other application implementing the same architecture
    - `PersistedStreamEngine`
        - It's an interface for reading/subscribing/writing messages streams (commands and command transactions streams in our case)
        - It contains one instance for the [EventStore](https://eventstore.org/)

All these packages will eventually be in their own github repository as they get more mature.

##  4. Emergent CQRS framework

One of the intent when starting this project was to get a CQRS Framework out of a concrete application.
This is what the package `Eventuria.CQRS` will eventually become...
To use this framework, you need to provide the following :

- a specific WriteModel for your application ([gsd example](../src/Eventuria/GSD/Write/Model/WriteModel.hs))
- mapping between the application events and the cqrs events ([gsd example](../src/Eventuria/GSD/Write/Model/Events/Event.hs))
- mapping between the application commands and the cqrs commands ([gsd example](../src/Eventuria/GSD/Write/Model/Commands/Command.hs))
- the orchestration flow for command consumption ([gsd example](../src/Eventuria/Libraries/CQRS/Write/CommandConsumption/Orchestration.hs))
    - 2 functions (ProjectWriteModel and HandleCommand)
        ```haskell
            data CommandHandlingResult =   CommandRejected   { reason ::  RejectionReason}
                                         | CommandValidated  { events ::  [Event]} deriving (Eq,Show)

            type ProjectWriteModel writeModel = Maybe writeModel -> CommandHandlingResult -> Maybe writeModel

            type HandleCommand writeModel = Maybe writeModel -> (Persisted Command) -> IO (CommandHandlingResult)
        ```
        - [Gsd `ProjectWriteModel` example](../src/Eventuria/GSD/Write/CommandConsumer/Handling/ProjectGSDWriteModel.hs)
        - [Gsd `HandleCommand` example](../src/Eventuria/GSD/Write/CommandConsumer/Handling/HandleGSDCommand.hs)
