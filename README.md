# GSD (Getting Stuffs Done)

GSD  is a basic todo list command-line application
- Organize your stuffs to be done by workspaces
    - e.g : Work, Sport, House, Vacations, Spanish ...
- Define the goals you wish to achieve within these workspaces
   - e.g : In the workspace "Spanish", you could add the goal "Mastering Spanish Grammar"
- Define the different actions to undertake for fulfilling these goals
   - e.g : Goal : "Mastering Spanish Grammar"
     - [x] Action 1 : Find a good book about Grammar
     - [ ] Action 2 : Learn the present tense of regular verbs, irregular verbs and verbs with spelling changes
     - [ ] Action 3 : Learn the present tense of verbs with stem changes
     - [ ] Action X : etc.
